/**
  * The metric: len/(ld + 1) - ld/(ld+1)
  * The way to arrive to it:
  * when ld = len => value = 0 (all of them changed they are not similar)
  * y = 1 when ld = 0 and length = 1
  * and y = 1 when len = ld*2 + 1 (at least 1 more than half of them should be not edited to be considered as similar as a single letter to itself)
  * so mathematically:
  * a*len+b = y
  * 1. len = 2ld + 1; ds = 1
  * 2. ld = len; ds = 0
  * and just solve it from here
  *
  * the only question how to calculate len?
